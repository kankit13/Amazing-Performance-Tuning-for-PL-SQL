                          Oracle Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor (ADDM)

Oracle's Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor (ADDM) is a wonderful performance tuning tool 
which examines database bottlenecks and recommendations for fixing the same.

the Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) takes a snapshot of database metrics once per hour. 
The difference between two snapshots tells a lot about what a database is doing. 

After ADDM takes a snapshot, it looks at performance over the past hour and 
automatically generates a report of its findings.
